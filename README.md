# TcpBounce
TcpBounce is a basic usermode packet redirecter built using C#, its original goal was to act as a RAW TCP proxy for internal use, however, this version includes a config file and multi-threaded async for multiple port forwarding compatibility. While this project is not actively maintained all pull-requests and issues will be vetted and accepted. Updates for **Bug fixes** at the request of a issue are accepted.
